2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/communicatie_protoco_0/U0/crc_d_fail_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/communicatie_protoco_0/U0/crc_d_fail_reg_i_1/O, cell design_1_i/communicatie_protoco_0/U0/crc_d_fail_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/communicatie_protoco_0/U0/crc_h_fail_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/communicatie_protoco_0/U0/crc_h_fail_reg_i_1/O, cell design_1_i/communicatie_protoco_0/U0/crc_h_fail_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/communicatie_protoco_0/U0/data_ready_output_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/communicatie_protoco_0/U0/data_ready_output_reg_i_1/O, cell design_1_i/communicatie_protoco_0/U0/data_ready_output_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/decoder_5b4b_0/U0/NS is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/decoder_5b4b_0/U0/FSM_onehot_NS_reg[5]_i_2/O, cell design_1_i/decoder_5b4b_0/U0/FSM_onehot_NS_reg[5]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/module_demodulator/demodulator_0/U0/output_ready_o_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/module_demodulator/demodulator_0/U0/output_ready_o_reg_i_2/O, cell design_1_i/module_demodulator/demodulator_0/U0/output_ready_o_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/module_demodulator/demodulator_0/U0/timer_enable_o_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/module_demodulator/demodulator_0/U0/timer_enable_o_reg_i_2/O, cell design_1_i/module_demodulator/demodulator_0/U0/timer_enable_o_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
